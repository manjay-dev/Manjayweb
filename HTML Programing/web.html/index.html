    <h2>FRIEND CIRCLE </h2>
<p>This insightful comment comes from a Year 5 pupil who has been part of a support network, a “circle of friends” for a fellow pupil in his class, Darren. Darren had shown difficult to manage and distressed behaviour throughout his school career. Over the past term a group of eight pupils from Darren’s class have been brought together (with the help of their class teacher and school educational psychologist) to give time and thought to how they can be supportive towards him in the things they do and let him know that they care about who and how he is. For his part Darren has responded by doing less of the things; refusing to work, running out of school and hiding, “calling” other pupils, becoming tearful at “slight” provocations that had previously made him so challenging for pupils and staff to live with and had led to his referral to the Educational Psychology Service.

    Here we describe the thinking behind this approach to meeting emotional and behavioural needs and the process by which the child’s peer group can become a source of support.
    
    The rationale behind the circle of friends approach is a simple one and, once understood, almost embarrassingly obvious. It recognises that a significant consequence for someone who shows distressed and difficult behaviour is their likely isolation from their peer group both in and out of school. Teachers will describe such pupils as” having no friends”,”unable to make or sustain relationships”, “always fighting or arguing with other pupils”. Pupils will describe them as “a nutter”, “mad”, “always getting done for something” – although as we shall see later when encouraged they are able to give much more balanced descriptions.</p>
